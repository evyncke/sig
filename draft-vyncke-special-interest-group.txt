                  draft-vyncke-special-interest-group

Abstract

   This document describes the guidelines for the formation and
   operation of a special kind of Working Group (WG): Special Interest
   Group (SIG).  SIGs differ from WG because their purpose is not to
   publish protocol or process; they are rather a place where discussion
   on existing IETF technologies can take place.

   This document updates RFC2418.

1.  Introduction

   Unofficial side meetings exist since at least IETF 99 and are quite
   useful and successful with a wide variety of topics.  But, they are
   non-official and they do not appear on the IETF meeting agenda, only
   on a side wiki page.  They are sometimes also a one time meeting, no
   continuity.

   There is a desire for some IETF members sharing the same interest in
   an IETF technology to discuss an already specified and deployed
   technology, mainly but not limited to operations.  The discussion
   could also include sharing experience in training, in glossaries, in
   how different technologies could interact, ...

   This document describes the guidelines for the formation and
   operation of a special kind of Working Group (WG): Special Interest
   Group (SIG).  SIGs differ from WG because their purpose is not to
   publish protocol or process; they are rather a place where discussion
   on existing IETF technologies can take place.

   The formation of SIG is similar to the normal [RFC2418] WG: one birds
   of feather (BoF) discussion within an area, Internet Engineering
   Steering Group (IESG) approval; the SIG operation is also similar
   with mailing list, data tracker to maintain the list of adopted and
   individual documents.  SIGs MAY have no milestone.

Internet-Draft                     SIG                    September 2020


   SIGs are terminated at the discretion of their Area Director (AD) who
   should review annually with the IESG and the SIG WG chairs whether
   the SIG should continue or be terminated.

   This document is based on the experience gained with the formation
   and operation of the Media Operations (MOPS) Working Group in 2019.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Modification of RFC 2418 for SIG

   [RFC2418] provides guidelines for the formation and operation of WG
   that are not fully in line with SIGs.  This section documents the
   differences.

3.1.  SIG Formation

3.1.1.  Criteria for formation

   When determining whether it is appropriate to create a special
   interest group, the Area Director(s) and the IESG will consider the
   same issues as in section 2.1 of [RFC2418] but MAY ignore the point
   "Are the goals specific and reasonably achievable, and achievable
   within a reasonable time frame?".  The reasoning is that SIG do not
   have goals, i.e., no protocols or processes will be designed.

3.1.2.  Charter

   SIGs MUST have a charter that is negotiated between a prospective
   working group Chair and the relevant Area Director(s), although final
   approval is made by the IESG with advice from the Internet
   Architecture Board (IAB).

   The elements of section 2.2 of [RFC2418] are all applicable at the
   exception of the milestones.  Milestones are OPTIONAL for SIG.
   Section 2.3 of [RFC2418] (charter review & approval) fully applies to
   SIG.

   Experience with the MOPS WG has shown that most SIGs will probably be
   in the Operation Area but the responsible Area Director MAY be
   different than the Operation Area Director.  As SIG may cover

   multiple areas, it is expected that there will be several technical
   advisors.

3.1.3.  Birds of a feather

   The section 2.4 of [RFC2418] is applicable to SIGs: BoF are also an
   instrument for the community to judge whether there is enough
   interest to create a SIG.

3.2.  SIG Operation

   Section 3 of [RFC2418] applies for SIGs: SIGs will operate with
   mailing list discussions but it is expected that the value of SIGs
   will be in the interim and plenary meetings.  The meetings will have
   an agenda and minutes will be posted as any other WG meeting.

   A SIG differs from [RFC2418] WG because it is expected that most
   presentations or documents will not be published in the IETF stream.
   Documents will probably be presented and discussed only once and will
   stay at revision 00 before expiring.  Nevertheless, a SIG MAY adopt
   documents if deemed useful for the wider community and these
   documents MAY be published in the IETF stream following the normal
   publication process.

   A SIG MAY identify new requirements and MAY help to identify
   candidate venues to address these requirements; possibly by
   identifying a more appropriate WG for the matter and/or document, and
   dispatch it.

3.3.  SIG Termination

   Section 4 of [RFC2418] does not apply to SIGs.  Indeed, SIGs are
   formed not to complete a task but more to provide a venue for
   discussion and information exchange.

   In order to avoid a never-ending SIG, the responsible AD and the SIG
   chairs will evaluate every year (at the anniversary date of the SIG
   creation) whether the SIG is still useful for the IETF community
   based on the SIG agenda, attendance, quality and quantity of
   discussions on the mailing list and during interim/plenary meeting.
   In the absence of activities, the SIG will be terminated.  The
   associated mailing list MAY be kept running.

   If the special interest group disagrees with the Area Director's
   choice, it may appeal to the IESG (see section 3.4 of [RFC2418]).

   A SIG MAY also be rechartered into a SIG or into a normal WG as
   described in section 5 of [RFC2418].

4.  Security Considerations

   Documents describing IETF processes, such as this one, do not have an
   impact on the security of the network infrastructure or of Internet
   applications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

6.  Acknowledgements

   This revision of this document is based on IESG discussions that
   happened during the creation of the MOPS Working Group with Leslie
   Daigle, Glenn Deen, Mirja Kuehlewind, Warren Kumari, and Barry Leiba.
